# Verizon Connect API
This module handles authentication and data-fetching with the Verizon 
Connect API. Currently, Verizon Connect uses the "Basic" HTTP 
authentication scheme, which requires a username and password. Use of 
the API will require registration of an app in their Developer Portal.

This project is not associated in any way with Verizon or Verizon Connect.
